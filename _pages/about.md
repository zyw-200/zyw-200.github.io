About Me
=======
I am currently a research fellow at Nanyang Technological University, under the supervision of Prof. [Liu Yang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/).
I received the Ph.D. in cyberspace security from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2020, under the supervision of Prof. Limin Sun.
During the period from 2017 to 2018, I also visited University of California, Riverside, under the supervision of Prof. [Heng Yin](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~heng/)

My research interests are related to system security. In particular, I am currenty focusing on vulnerability analysis techniques for IoT system and firmware including both static analysis techniques such as taint analysis, as well as dynamic techniques like emulation-based fuzzing.
